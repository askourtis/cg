Nearest Neighbor Pattern Matching for 3D Meshes

This module implements a pattern matching system that uses nearest neighbor
algorithms to compare geometric features between 3D mesh surfaces. The approach
extracts characteristic features from vertices and uses bidirectional matching
to compute similarity scores.

Classes:
    NearestNeighborMatcher: Main class for training and predicting mesh similarity

The matching algorithm computes bidirectional similarity to ensure robust
pattern detection regardless of mesh orientation or vertex ordering.

    """A pattern matcher that uses nearest neighbors to compare mesh geometric features.

    This class implements a bidirectional nearest neighbor approach for comparing
    3D mesh surfaces. It extracts geometric features from vertices and uses
    k-nearest neighbors to find correspondences between meshes.

    The similarity computation is bidirectional (A->B and B->A) to ensure
    robust matching regardless of mesh complexity differences.

    Attributes:
        feature_array (np.ndarray): Stored feature vectors from the fitted mesh.
        reduce (callable): Function to reduce distance arrays (default: np.max).

    Example:
        >>> matcher = NearestNeighborMatcher()
        >>> matcher.fit(template_mesh)
        >>> similarity = matcher.predict(test_mesh)  # Not normalized
